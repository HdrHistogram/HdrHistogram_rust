//! HdrSample is a port of Gil Tene's HdrHistogram to native Rust. It provides recording and
//! analyzing of sampled data value counts across a large, configurable value range with
//! configurable precision within the range. The resulting "HDR" histogram allows for fast and
//! accurate analysis of the extreme ranges of data with non-normal distributions, like latency.
//!
//! # HdrHistogram
//!
//! What follows is a description from [the HdrHistogram
//! website](https://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/). Users are encouraged to read the
//! documentation from the original [Java
//! implementation](https://github.com/HdrHistogram/HdrHistogram), as most of the concepts
//! translate directly to the Rust port.
//!
//! HdrHistogram supports the recording and analyzing of sampled data value counts across a
//! configurable integer value range with configurable value precision within the range. Value
//! precision is expressed as the number of significant digits in the value recording, and provides
//! control over value quantization behavior across the value range and the subsequent value
//! resolution at any given level.
//!
//! For example, a Histogram could be configured to track the counts of observed integer values
//! between 0 and 3,600,000,000 while maintaining a value precision of 3 significant digits across
//! that range. Value quantization within the range will thus be no larger than 1/1,000th (or 0.1%)
//! of any value. This example Histogram could be used to track and analyze the counts of observed
//! response times ranging between 1 microsecond and 1 hour in magnitude, while maintaining a value
//! resolution of 1 microsecond up to 1 millisecond, a resolution of 1 millisecond (or better) up
//! to one second, and a resolution of 1 second (or better) up to 1,000 seconds. At it's maximum
//! tracked value (1 hour), it would still maintain a resolution of 3.6 seconds (or better).
//!
//! HDR Histogram is designed for recording histograms of value measurements in latency and
//! performance sensitive applications. Measurements show value recording times as low as 3-6
//! nanoseconds on modern (circa 2014) Intel CPUs. The HDR Histogram maintains a fixed cost in both
//! space and time. A Histogram's memory footprint is constant, with no allocation operations
//! involved in recording data values or in iterating through them. The memory footprint is fixed
//! regardless of the number of data value samples recorded, and depends solely on the dynamic
//! range and precision chosen. The amount of work involved in recording a sample is constant, and
//! directly computes storage index locations such that no iteration or searching is ever involved
//! in recording data values.
//!
//! If you are looking for FFI bindings to
//! [`HdrHistogram_c`](https://github.com/HdrHistogram/HdrHistogram_c), you want the
//! [`hdrhistogram_c`](https://crates.io/crates/hdrhistogram_c) crate instead.
//!
//! # Interacting with the library
//!
//! HdrSample's API follows that of the original HdrHistogram Java implementation, with some
//! modifications to make its use more idiomatic in Rust. The description in this section has been
//! adapted from that given by the [Python port](https://github.com/HdrHistogram/HdrHistogram_py),
//! as it gives a nicer first-time introduction to the use of HdrHistogram than the Java docs do.
//!
//! HdrSample is generally used in one of two modes: recording samples, or querying for analytics.
//! In distributed deployments, the recording may be performed remotely (and possibly in multiple
//! locations), to then be aggregated later in a central location for analysis.
//!
//! ## Recording samples
//!
//! A histogram instance is created using the `::new` methods on the `Histogram` struct. These come
//! in three variants: `new`, `new_with_max`, and `new_with_bounds`. The first of these only sets
//! the required precision of the sampled data, but leaves the value range open such that any value
//! may be recorded. A `Histogram` created this way (or one where auto-resize has been explicitly
//! enabled) will automatically resize itself if a value that is too large to fit in the current
//! dataset is encountered. `new_with_max` sets an upper bound on the values to be recorded, and
//! disables auto-resizing, thus preventing any re-allocation during recording. If the application
//! attempts to record a larger value than this maximum bound, the `record` call will return an
//! error. Finally, `new_with_bounds` restricts the lowest representable value of the dataset,
//! such that a smaller range needs to be covered (thus reducing the overall allocation size).
//!
//! For example the example below shows how to create a `Histogram` that can count values in the
//! `[1..3600000]` range with 1% precision, which could be used to track latencies in the range `[1
//! msec..1 hour]`).
//!
//! ```
//! use hdrhistogram::Histogram;
//! let mut hist = Histogram::<u64>::new_with_bounds(1, 60 * 60 * 1000, 2).unwrap();
//!
//! // samples can be recorded using .record, which will error if the value is too small or large
//! hist.record(54321).expect("value 54321 should be in range");
//!
//! // for ergonomics, samples can also be recorded with +=
//! // this call will panic if the value is out of range!
//! hist += 54321;
//!
//! // if the code that generates the values is subject to Coordinated Omission,
//! // the self-correcting record method should be used instead.
//! // for example, if the expected sampling interval is 10 msec:
//! hist.record_correct(54321, 10).expect("value 54321 should be in range");
//! ```
//!
//! Note the `u64` type. This type can be changed to reduce the storage overhead for all the
//! histogram bins, at the cost of a risk of saturating if a large number of samples end up in the
//! same bin.
//!
//! ## Querying samples
//!
//! At any time, the histogram can be queried to return interesting statistical measurements, such
//! as the total number of recorded samples, or the value at a given quantile:
//!
//! ```
//! use hdrhistogram::Histogram;
//! let hist = Histogram::<u64>::new(2).unwrap();
//! // ...
//! println!("# of samples: {}", hist.len());
//! println!("99.9'th percentile: {}", hist.value_at_quantile(0.999));
//! ```
//!
//! Several useful iterators are also provided for quickly getting an overview of the dataset. The
//! simplest one is `iter_recorded()`, which yields one item for every non-empty sample bin. All
//! the HdrHistogram iterators are supported in HdrSample, so look for the `*Iterator` classes in
//! the [Java documentation](https://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/JavaDoc/).
//!
//! ```
//! use hdrhistogram::Histogram;
//! let hist = Histogram::<u64>::new(2).unwrap();
//! // ...
//! for v in hist.iter_recorded() {
//!     println!("{}'th percentile of data is {} with {} samples",
//!         v.percentile(), v.value_iterated_to(), v.count_at_value());
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Panics and error handling
//!
//! As long as you're using safe, non-panicking functions (see below), this library should never
//! panic. Any panics you encounter are a bug; please file them in the issue tracker.
//!
//! A few functions have their functionality exposed via `AddAssign` and `SubAssign`
//! implementations. These alternate forms are equivalent to simply calling `unwrap()` on the
//! normal functions, so the normal rules of `unwrap()` apply: view with suspicion when used in
//! production code, etc.
//!
//! | Returns Result                 | Panics on error    | Functionality                   |
//! | ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
//! | `h.record(v)`                  | `h += v`           | Increment count for value `v`   |
//! | `h.add(h2)`                    | `h += h2`          | Add `h2`'s counts to `h`        |
//! | `h.subtract(h2)`               | `h -= h2`          | Subtract `h2`'s counts from `h` |
//!
//! Other than the panicking forms of the above functions, everything will return `Result` or
//! `Option` if it can fail.
//!
//! ## `usize` limitations
//!
//! Depending on the configured number of significant digits and maximum value, a histogram's
//! internal storage may have hundreds of thousands of cells. Systems with a 16-bit `usize` cannot
//! represent pointer offsets that large, so relevant operations (creation, deserialization, etc)
//! will fail with a suitable error (e.g. `CreationError::UsizeTypeTooSmall`). If you are using such
//! a system and hitting these errors, reducing the number of significant digits will greatly reduce
//! memory consumption (and therefore the need for large `usize` values). Lowering the max value may
//! also help as long as resizing is disabled.
//!
//! 32- and above systems will not have any such issues, as all possible histograms fit within a
//! 32-bit index.
//!
//! ## Floating point accuracy
//!
//! Some calculations inherently involve floating point values, like `value_at_quantile`, and are
//! therefore subject to the precision limits of IEEE754 floating point calculations. The user-
//! visible consequence of this is that in certain corner cases, you might end up with a bucket (and
//! therefore value) that is higher or lower than it would be if the calculation had been done
//! with arbitrary-precision arithmetic. However, double-precision IEEE754 (i.e. `f64`) is very
//! good at its job, so these cases should be rare. Also, we haven't seen a case that was off by
//! more than one bucket.
//!
//! To minimize FP precision losses, we favor working with quantiles rather than percentiles. A
//! quantile represents a portion of a set with a number in `[0, 1]`. A percentile is the same
//! concept, except it uses the range `[0, 100]`. Working just with quantiles means we can skip an
//! FP operation in a few places, and therefore avoid opportunities for precision loss to creep in.
//!
//! # Limitations and Caveats
//!
//! As with all the other HdrHistogram ports, the latest features and bug fixes from the upstream
//! HdrHistogram implementations may not be available in this port. A number of features have also
//! not (yet) been implemented:
//!
//!  - Concurrency support (`AtomicHistogram`, `ConcurrentHistogram`, …).
//!  - `DoubleHistogram`.
//!  - The `Recorder` feature of HdrHistogram.
//!  - Value shifting ("normalization").
//!  - Textual output methods. These seem almost orthogonal to HdrSample, though it might be
//!    convenient if we implemented some relevant traits (CSV, JSON, and possibly simple
//!    `fmt::Display`).
//!
//! Most of these should be fairly straightforward to add, as the code aligns pretty well with the
//! original Java/C# code. If you do decide to implement one and send a PR, please make sure you
//! also port the [test
//! cases](https://github.com/HdrHistogram/HdrHistogram/tree/master/src/test/java/org/HdrHistogram),
//! and try to make sure you implement appropriate traits to make the use of the feature as
//! ergonomic as possible.

/// well as the user-specified number of significant decimal digits to preserve. The values for the
/// buckets are kept in a way that resembles floats and doubles: there is a mantissa and an
/// exponent, and each bucket represents a different exponent. The "sub-buckets" within a bucket
/// represent different values for the mantissa.
///
/// To a first approximation, the sub-buckets of the first
/// bucket would hold the values `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, …, the sub-buckets of the second bucket would
/// hold `0`, `2`, `4`, `6`, …, the third would hold `0`, `4`, `8`, and so on. However, the low

    /// The iteration mechanic for this iterator may appear somewhat confusing, but it yields
    /// fairly pleasing output. The iterator starts with a *quantile step size* of
    /// `1/halving_period`. For every iteration, it yields a value whose quantile is that much
    /// greater than the previously emitted quantile (i.e., initially 0, 0.1, 0.2, etc.). Once
    /// `halving_period` values have been emitted, the quantile  step size is halved, and the
    /// iteration continues.
    ///
    /// `ticks_per_half_distance` must be at least 1.
    ///
    /// The iterator yields an `iterators::IterationValue` struct.
    ///
    /// One subtlety of this iterator is that you can reach a value whose cumulative count yields
    /// a quantile of 1.0 far sooner than the quantile iteration would reach 1.0. Consider a
    /// histogram with count 1 at value 1, and count 1000000 at value 1000. At any quantile
    /// iteration above `1/1000001 = 0.000000999`, iteration will have necessarily proceeded to
    /// the index for value 1000, which has all the remaining counts, and therefore quantile (for
    /// the value) of 1.0. This is why `IterationValue` has both `quantile()` and
    /// `quantile_iterated_to()`. Additionally, to avoid a bunch of unhelpful iterations once
