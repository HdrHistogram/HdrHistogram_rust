//! Interval log parsing and writing.
//!
//! Interval logs, as handled by the Java implementation's `HistogramLogWriter`,
//! `HistogramLogReader`, and `HistogramLogProcessor`, are a way to record a sequence of histograms
//! over time. Suppose you were running a load test for an hour: you might want to record a
//! histogram per second or minute so that you could correlate measurements with behavior you might
//! see in logs, etc.
//!
//! An interval log contains some initial metadata, then a sequence of histograms, each with some
//! additional metadata (timestamps, etc). See `IntervalLogHistogram`.
//!
//! The intervals in the log should be ordered by start timestamp. It's possible to write (and
//! parse) logs with intervals in any order, but the expectation is that they will be sorted.
//!
//! To parse a log, see `IntervalLogIterator`. To write a log, see `IntervalLogWriterBuilder`.
//!
//! # Timestamps
//!
//! Each interval has a timestamp in seconds associated with it. However, it's not necessarily as
//! simple as just interpreting the number as seconds since the epoch. There are two optional pieces
//! of header metadata: "StartTime" and "BaseTime". Neither, one, or both of these may be present.
//! It is possible to have multiple StartTime or BaseTime entries in the log, or even interleaved
//! with interval histograms, but that is confusing, so this API prevents you from doing so.
//!
//! When BaseTime is present, per-interval timestamps are the number of seconds since BaseTime. When
//! it is absent, the per-interval timestamps represent fractional seconds since the epoch (aka
//! Unix time). BaseTime is useful because it allows you to have somewhat human-readable timestamps
//! for each interval -- it's easier to see 245.3 and see that that's 4 minutes after the start of
//! whatever it is you're doing than it is to mentally parse a Unix timestamp. Naturally, you can
//! always calculate the deltas after the fact if you're willing to write a little tooling, but in
//! some cases log files are consumed by humans too.
//!
//! While BaseTime is used to redefine per-interval timestamps for human readability, StartTime
//! provides information about when the process that is generating the log reached some "start"
//! condition. It's frequently the case that intervals will start some seconds after the process
//! started, whether due to initial warmup before a benchmark or because it just takes a
//! while to start up. If this is relevant to your workload, use StartTime to record the actual
//! process start time (or other relevant "start" condition, like when a benchmark begins on an
//! already long-running process). You could then use this when processing a log to more accurately
//! plot interval data over time. Put differently, StartTime doesn't change the interpretation of
//! interval timestamps directly like BaseTime; instead, it provides a hint to the consumer of the
//! log that the "start" (whatever that means to you -- process start, etc) was at a different time
//! than that associated with the first interval.
//!
//! #### Example scenario
//!
//! To explain their usage, suppose we're running a multi-hour benchmark on a process that starts
//! up at a Unix time of 1500000000. We'll be recording separate log files per hour just to
//! demonstrate the interaction between BaseTime, StartTime, and interval log timestamps.
//!
//! The process starts up, warms up its caches, JIT compiles, etc and is ready to start its
//! benchmark 40 seconds later, so we create the first interval log file and record a StartTime of
//! 1500000040. If the actual process start (rather than benchmark start) is more useful to you,
//! using a StartTime of 1500000000 would be reasonable, but we'll stick with 1500000040.
//!
//! We'll use a BaseTime of 1500000040 because that's when the benchmark began, but 1500000000 would
//! also be a reasonable choice here -- it would just make the per-interval deltas 40 seconds
//! larger, which might be a more useful way of recording them, depending on the situation.
//!
//! The benchmark produces an interval histogram for each 60 seconds of workload, so the first one
//! is ready at 1500000100, and is recorded with a delta timestamp of 60. This goes on for another
//! hour, with the last one being 3540 seconds after the start of the benchmark with a corresponding
//! delta of 3540.
//!
//! At the start of the second hour, the time is 1500003640 and the first log file is ended (which
//! is straightforward: just stop writing to it and close the file) and the second log file is
//! opened. It still uses a StartTime of 1500000040 because we want to represent that this log
//! pertains to something that started an hour ago, but we'll use a BaseTime of 1500003640 so that
//! our delta timestamps start over at 0. Again, you could just as well decide to use the same
//! BaseTime of 1500000040 if you prefer, but it's arguably easier for a human to parse "h hours
//! into the benchmark, s seconds past the hour" than it is to mentally divide by 3600, so we'll
//! go with the new BaseTime.
//!
//! Suppose now you wanted to process these logs and show information (e.g. the 0.999th quantile of
//! each interval) as the y-axis on a plot where time is the x-axis. You would want to have
//! StartTime be the zero of the x-axis. For each interval, calculate the Unix time by adding its
//! timestamp to BaseTime, where BaseTime is assumed to be zero if it's not specified. The point on
//! the x-axis for that interval would be the result of subtracting StartTime from that Unix time.
//! As an example, the 17th minute in the 2nd hour would have an interval timestamp of approximately
//! 1020, which when added to 1500003640 is 1500004660. The difference between StartTime and then is
//! 4620. You might choose to display that in units of minutes, which would be 4620 / 60 = 77.
//!
//! #### Java interop
//!
//! Since you may be interoperating with the Java reference implementation, here's a summary of the
//! logic used by the `HistogramLogReader` class for StartTime and BaseTime. It's slightly different
//! than what was described above, presumably for legacy compatibility reasons. This class stores
//! the StartTime as a field which is exposed via a getter, and also integrates filtering intervals
//! based on windows for either "absolute" (Unix time) timestamps or "offset" timestamps (delta vs
//! the StartTime), so if you're using that filtering functionality, you need to understand how it
//! ends up setting its internal version of StartTime.
//!
//! - Neither StartTime nor BaseTime are present: interval timestamps are interpreted as seconds
//! since the epoch. The first interval's timestamp is stored to the StartTime field.
//! - StartTime is present: StartTime is a number of seconds since epoch, and interval timestamps
//! may be interpreted as deltas to be added to StartTime or as "absolute" Unix time depending on a
//! heuristic. In other words, the heuristic chooses between setting the effective BaseTime to 0 or
//! to StartTime. Specifically, the heuristic interprets interval timestamps as deltas if they are
//! more than a year's worth of seconds smaller than StartTime and as absolute timestamps otherwise.
//! - BaseTime is present: BaseTime is a number of seconds since epoch, and interval timestamps are
//! interpreted as deltas. The first interval's (delta) timestamp is stored to the StartTime field.
//! This is likely a bug, since StartTime should be an absolute timestamp, and appears to cause
//! erroneous behavior when filtering by offset timestamps.
//! - BaseTime and StartTime are present: The BaseTime is used like it is when it's the only one
//! present: it's a number of seconds since epoch that serves as the starting point for the
//! per-interval deltas to get a wall-clock time for each interval. No heuristics are applied to
//! guess whether or not the intervals are absolute or deltas.
//!
//! The Java implementation also supports re-setting the StartTime and BaseTime if those entries
//! exist more than once in the log. Suppose that you had an hour's worth of per-minute intervals,
//! and then you set another StartTime to the current time and added a second hour's worth of
//! intervals. Filtering for "all intervals between 5 and 10 minutes past the start" would result in
//! two disjoint sequences of intervals, which is at the very least arguably unintuitive. However,
//! you may well be working with log files that are structured that way, so this implementation's
//! `IntervalLogIterator` will expose multiple StartTime, etc, entries as they appear in the log
//! file.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Parse a single interval from a log.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::time;
//! use hdrhistogram::serialization::interval_log;
//!
//! // two newline-separated log lines: a comment, then an interval
//! let log = b"#I'm a comment\nTag=t,0.127,1.007,2.769,base64EncodedHisto\n";
//!
//! let mut iter = interval_log::IntervalLogIterator::new(&log[..]);
//!
//! // the comment is consumed and ignored by the parser, so the first event is an Interval
//! match iter.next().unwrap() {
//!     Ok(interval_log::LogEntry::Interval(h)) => {
//!         assert_eq!(time::Duration::new(0, 127_000_000), h.start_timestamp());
//!     }
//!     _ => panic!()
//! }
//!
//! // there are no more lines in the log; iteration complete
//! assert_eq!(None, iter.next());
//! ```
//!
//! Skip logs that started before 3 seconds.
//!
//! ```
//! use hdrhistogram::serialization::interval_log;
//!

//!     #I'm a comment\n\

/// doing all the allocation, etc, of deserialization.
///
/// If you're looking for a direct port of the Java impl's `HistogramLogReader`, this isn't one: it
/// won't deserialize for you, and it pushes the burden of figuring out what to do with StartTime,
/// BaseTime, etc to you, and there aren't built in functions to filter by timestamp. On the other
/// hand, because it doesn't do those things, it is much more flexible: you can easily build any
/// sort of filtering you want, not just timestamp ranges, because you have cheap access to all the
/// metadata before incurring the cost of deserialization. If you're not using any timestamp
/// headers, or at least using them in straightforward ways, it is easy to accumulate the
/// timestamp state you need. Since all the parsing is taken care of already, writing your own
/// `HistogramLogReader` equivalent that fits the way your logs are assembled is just a couple of
/// lines. (And if you're doing complex stuff, we probably wouldn't have built something that fits
/// your quirky logs anyway!)

/// This parses from a slice representing the complete file because it made implementation easier
/// (and also supports mmap'd files for maximum parsing speed). If parsing from a `Read` is
/// important for your use case, open an issue about it.
